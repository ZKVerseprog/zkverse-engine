# @zkverse/zk-circuits

This package contains placeholder circuits that represent the zkVerse Engine
idea in terms of:

- a deposit circuit (commitment generation),
- a withdrawal circuit (nullifier verification).

These circuits are **not** production-ready and must be rewritten and audited
before mainnet zk usage.
